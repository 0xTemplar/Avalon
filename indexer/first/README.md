### üîç Filtering and Sorting

#### Common Filter Examples

```graphql
# Filter by status
quests(where: { status: ACTIVE })

# Filter by amount range
quests(where: {
  bountyAmount_gte: "100000000000000000",
  bountyAmount_lte: "1000000000000000000"
})

# Filter by creator
quests(where: { creator: "0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b8D091Aa19D26ff1f7" })

# Filter by multiple statuses
submissions(where: { status_in: [APPROVED, WINNER] })

# Filter by date range
quests(where: {
  createdAt_gte: "1640995200",
  createdAt_lte: "1672531200"
})

# Text search in title (contains)
quests(where: { title_contains: "Development" })

# Filter active participants
questParticipants(where: { isActive: true })
```

#### Common Sorting Examples

```graphql
# Sort by creation date (newest first)
quests(orderBy: createdAt, orderDirection: desc)

# Sort by bounty amount (highest first)
quests(orderBy: bountyAmount, orderDirection: desc)

# Sort by reputation (highest first)
users(orderBy: reputation, orderDirection: desc)

# Sort by like count (most liked first)
submissions(orderBy: likeCount, orderDirection: desc)
```

#### Pagination Examples

```graphql
# First 10 items
quests(first: 10)

# Skip first 10, get next 10
quests(first: 10, skip: 10)

# Get items after a specific ID
quests(first: 10, where: { id_gt: "0x05" })
```

## üîë Important Notes

### Bytes vs String IDs

Most entity IDs are of type `Bytes!` and need to be queried using hexadecimal format:

- User ID: `"0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b8D091Aa19D26ff1f7"`
- Platform Stats ID: `"0x504c4154464f524d5f5354415453"` (hex of "PLATFORM_STATS")

### BigInt Fields

All numeric fields are `BigInt!` and should be treated as strings in queries:

- Amounts: `"1000000000000000000"` (1 ETH in wei)
- Timestamps: `"1640995200"` (Unix timestamp)

### Relationship Queries

Use `@derivedFrom` relationships to efficiently query related data:

```graphql
user {
  createdQuests { ... }     # All quests created by user
  submissions { ... }       # All submissions by user
  rewards { ... }          # All rewards received by user
}
```

### Query Limits

- Maximum `first` parameter: 1000
- For larger datasets, use pagination with `skip`
- Use specific filtering to reduce result sets
